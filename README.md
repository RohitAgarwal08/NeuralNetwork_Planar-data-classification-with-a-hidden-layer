# NeuralNetwork_Planar-data-classification-with-a-hidden-layer
Problem Statement : Build a planar data classification with a hidden layer.

Here we will generate red and blue points to form a flower, then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points. Also we will different layers and see the results.

The generated dataset and some useful functions is in the file "planar_utils.py"

Note : This problem statement and dataset is from Coursera Andrew Ng's Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
